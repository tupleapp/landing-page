To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:

```
yarn dev
```

Webpack Development Server will watch `src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and
rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `src/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.

To build a production bundle run:

```
yarn prod
```

After that you will have a ready to deploy bundle at `/dist`
